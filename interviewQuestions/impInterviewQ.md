  - Waht is the L2 cache
The L2 cache (Level 2 cache) is a type of high-speed memory in a computer's memory hierarchy, located between the L1 cache (Level 1 cache) and the main memory (RAM). It is designed to store frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the time it takes for the CPU to access them, improving overall system performance.


  -What is encapsulation:
  Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It restricts direct access to the internal details of an object and protects data from accidental modification.

Key Features of Encapsulation
✔ Data Hiding – Prevents direct access to object attributes.
✔ Access Modifiers – Controls visibility using:

private (accessible only within the class)
protected (accessible within the class and subclasses)
public (accessible from anywhere)
✔ Getter and Setter Methods – Used to access and modify private variables.
