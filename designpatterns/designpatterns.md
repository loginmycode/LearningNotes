# Design Patterns

Note:-
 - important things are kept in `backticks`

## What's a design pattern?
        Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
        They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Design Patterns :

Creational patterns : 
        provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Structural patterns 
        explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures,
         while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Behavioral patterns
        take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Creational patterns : These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
        
        -Factory Method
                        Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
                        but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created
        -abstract Factory
        -Builder
        -Prototype
        -singleton
                    *Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, 
                     while providing a global access point to this instance.

                     1) Ensure that a class has just a single instance - Single object
                     2) Provide a global access point to that instance - You can access globaly same classes


Structural patterns:- These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

        -bridge
        -composite
        -decotator
        -Facade
        -flywieght
        -proxy
Behavioral patterns : These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

        -Chain of responsibility
        -Command
        -Iterator
        -Mediator
        -Memento
        -Observer
        -State
        -Statergy
        -Template Method
        -Visitors
